## Description
This is a simple, Node-based markdown file generator that asks the user a simple series of questions (prompts) and returns a file entitled "newREADME.md."  It will provide the user the chance to showcase a badge determined by the license as well as a link to the user's GitHub page.    

## Usage Information

You can use this to generate a README for any GitHub project.  In fact, I used it to generate this very README!
